## 🔑 Roles & Responsibilities

### 🧑‍🔬 Data Science (DS)
- Collect and clean datasets (CICIDS, UNSW-NB15, KDDCup99).  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Engineer features (IP addresses, ports, traffic volume).  
- Create visualizations and dashboards.  

### 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)
- Build and train ML models for anomaly detection.  
- Validate models with metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Optimize and fine-tune models for accuracy.  

### 🔐 Cybersecurity
- Define security rules or suspicious patterns (e.g., brute force, DDoS).  
- Integrate rule-based checks into the detection engine.  
- Ensure secure data handling and compliance.  

### 👨‍💻 Developer / Dashboard Engineer
- Build dashboard/web app (Flask/Streamlit or React).  
- Integrate ML predictions and cybersecurity alerts.  
- Add authentication/login system.  
- Visualize real-time results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (optional)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit or Flask + React  
- **Security:** Basic authentication, hashing (bcrypt)

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Collect and preprocess** network traffic datasets.  
2. **Perform EDA** to understand traffic behavior.  
3. **Engineer features** from IP, ports, and traffic patterns.  
4. **Train ML models** for anomaly detection.  
5. **Add security rules** for known attack patterns.  
6. **Deploy dashboard** for live alerts and monitoring.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered-Cyber-Threat-Detection-Dashboard.git
   cd AI-Powered-Cyber-Threat-Detection-Dashboard
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r req.txt
Run the dashboard (Streamlit example):

bash
